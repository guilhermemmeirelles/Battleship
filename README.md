<h1> Battleships </h1>
Block 2 Project for Computer Science Year 1 @ Middlesex University 


Description:

  In this very simple version on the Battleships board game, two players can play against each other on the same machine, taking turns at aiming at coordinates to try to take down the opponents Battleships.
   
  The grid has 16 coordinates - A1 to D4 - in which the player can place their Cruiser (3 pieces long) and their Destroyer (2 pieces long). After placing their ships, the players take turns at aiming at the opponent's ships, but will have to turn around after each turn, as the screen is shared.
  
  The first one to shoot down both ships wins!

<h2> INSTRUCTIONS: </h2>


1. Download files <a href="https://github.com/guilhermemmeirelles/Battleship/releases/tag/v0.1-alpha">here</a>.

2. Run Battleship.exe.
  
3. New Game will show the grid. Pressing start will allow you to start placing pieces.
  
4. To place the ships, enter the desired coordinate (A1 to D4) into the text-box above "start" and press enter.
  
      4.1 The first ship is 3 pieces long, so they must all be placed together. Same for the second (2 piece long) ship.

5. After both player place their ships, they can use the same text-box to aim at a coordinate in the grid and try to take down the opponents ships.
 
6. After a hit, the player gets another turn. If they miss, the coordinate will turn black, so they know it can't be shot again.
  
7. When a player shoots down both of the opponents ships, they win.
